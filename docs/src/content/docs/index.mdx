# UseCallManager Security Services

A modern implementation of security services for Cisco IP Phone systems, providing CAPF (Certificate Authority Proxy Function) and TVS (Trust Verification Service) capabilities.

## What is UseCallManager?

UseCallManager provides the essential security infrastructure that Cisco IP Phones need to establish secure communications:

  <Card title="CAPF" icon="document">
    **Certificate Authority Proxy Function**

    Issues and manages Locally Significant Certificates (LSCs) for phones
  </Card>
  <Card title="TVS" icon="approve-check">
    **Trust Verification Service**

    Provides certificate validation and trust verification

  <Card title="Security Tools" icon="seti:lock">
    **Configuration Security**

    Generate ITL files and encrypt device configurations
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Certificate Management" icon="document">
    - Issue LSCs to Cisco IP Phones via SCEP-like protocol
    - Support for RSA (1024-2048 bit) and EC (secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1) keys
    - Device lifecycle management (pending, issued, expired states)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Trust Verification" icon="approve-check">
    - ITL (Initial Trust List) file generation with certificate chains
    - Config file encryption for device-specific secure configuration delivery
    - PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures with SHA-512 for integrity
  </Card>

  <Card title="Modern Architecture" icon="rocket">
    - FastAPI backend with SQLite/PostgreSQL database
    - Astro frontend with React islands for interactive components
    - Docker Compose deployment with Caddy reverse proxy
    - RESTful APIs for integration with external configuration services
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Getting Started

<Steps>

1. **Deploy the services**

   Follow the [Installation & Setup](./installation) guide to get your services running

2. **Integrate with your system**

   Use the [API Reference](./api/overview) to integrate with your configuration service

3. **Secure your deployment**

   Review [Security Best Practices](./security/best-practices) to protect your infrastructure

</Steps>

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐
│ Cisco Phone │ ──┬─→ CAPF Protocol (port 3804) ──→ Certificate Issuance
└─────────────┘   │
                  └─→ HTTPS API ──→ ITL Files, Config Encryption

┌──────────────────┐
│ Config Service   │ ──→ HTTPS API ──→ Generate ITL, Encrypt Configs
└──────────────────┘
```

The CAPF protocol handles certificate enrollment from phones, while the HTTPS APIs provide integration points for configuration services to generate ITL files and encrypt device-specific configurations.
